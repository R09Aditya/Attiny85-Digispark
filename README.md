# Attiny85-Digispark
I am made a digispark attiny85 usb pcb. As this is my first time making a pcb i started with a begginer project and learning through youtube video on step by step guide on making a pcb. It is a very common digispark pendrive used for alot of cybersecurity activities.

# Why I made this
