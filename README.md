# Attiny85-Digispark
I am made a digispark attiny85 usb pcb. As this is my first time making a pcb i started with a begginer project and learning through youtube video on step by step guide on making a pcb. It is a very common digispark pendrive used for alot of cybersecurity activities.

# Why I made this
First things first, i made this because i just wanted to learn the basic of pcb designing as this is my first time designing a pcb. Also as i am interested into cyber security and ethical hacking i choosed this as my first project.
