## 11/5/2025 - Made the PCB Schematics  

I made the whole pcb schematics and also made custom symbol and footprint for the custom usb connector.
Also had some error when uploading it to PCB editor, so got rid of them as well.

## 11/8/2025 - Made the readme and the BOM  

i have completed it in 2 journals. but i didn't knew that i need minnimum 3 journals to submit the project. So can i now just make a journal of the BOM and readme etc, and keep the time 0.0 hours....I asked in the #blueprint-support a lot of time regarding this but no one replied properly. so i am just making one. So sorry if this is not a proper way to do so....
